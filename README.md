Experimenting with k8s cluster management by using libvirt + Fedora CoreOS VMs.

## TODO
- Add "offline" installation options using the dependencies
- Derive the addons from upstream releases by applying changes
  - Possibly use helm templates instead of raw manifests?
- Distributed storage
- Complete example web app
- Stretch goal: email-as-a-k8s-service
